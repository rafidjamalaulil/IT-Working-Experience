# REFLECTION 

Working on this project allowed me to explore and enhance my technical skills, particularly in using tools like Autodesk Inventor and Microsoft Excel. The objective of designing a 3D model and creating a decision information system challenged me to think critically and creatively, especially when faced with learning a new software platform.

My role involved preparing and editing the 3D design as well as developing a functional prototype. This was not without its challenges, as I had to learn the software from scratch and ensure the accuracy of the information presented. To overcome these obstacles, I relied on online tutorials and a trial-and-error approach, which not only helped me achieve my goals but also deepened my problem-solving skills.

The outcome of the project—a functional 3D design—was both rewarding and insightful. It demonstrated the practical application of design tools in creating solutions that could be implemented in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the project strengthened my understanding of decision information systems and their importance in managing complex data efficiently.

Reflecting on this experience, I realize how valuable it was in shaping my analytical thinking and technical expertise. It has also motivated me to continue developing these skills for future projects and challenges.
